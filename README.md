![Oh Hello there!](https://github.com/vagman/vagman/blob/master/banner_image.png)
Hi. I'm Vaggelis. I am a student in Informatics, University of Piraeus.

Allthough 2020 has been a crazy year, I'm working this summer on passing University courses such as [Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm), [Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus) and in the mean time taking care of this amazing project: [UniStudents](https://github.com/NickSklA/unistudents), by [Nikos Sklavounos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikos-sklavounos/)
