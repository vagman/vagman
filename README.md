![Oh Hello there!](https://github.com/vagman/vagman/blob/master/vagman.png)
Hi. I'm Vaggelis. I am a student in [Informatics, University of Piraeus](http://www.cs.unipi.gr/index.php?lang=en).

Allthough 2021 has been a crazy year, I'm working on passing University courses such as [Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm), [Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus) and in the mean time taking care of this amazing project: [UniStudents](https://github.com/NickSklA/unistudents), by [Nikos Sklavounos](https://github.com/NickSklA). If you want to learn more about me, visit my [website](https://manousakisvaggelis.com).
